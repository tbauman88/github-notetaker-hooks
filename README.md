# Githib Notetaker - create-react-native-app with React Hooks

[![prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://prettier.io/)

This app is an updated version of the one developed through the great course [React Native Fundamentals](https://egghead.io/courses/react-native-fundamentals) by Tyler McGinnis.
It's a React Native app mostly ment to work on iOS which uses the github API to access users' profile, repositories and which allows you to take notes about the different profiles.

## Differences are:

- Updated the parts using deprecated `react-native` components or deprecated syntax
- Using more ES6 syntax in order to refactor the code
- Updated to use `react-hooks`, `react-navigation` and `expo`

## Run 

Make sure you have Node v6 or later installed. No Xcode or Android Studio installation is required.

```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
$ npm start
```

The `npm start` command starts the Expo CLI server. You can now run the project on your phone by using the Expo app.
